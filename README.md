# Text-to-Speech (TTS) Python Script

This simple Python script demonstrates how to convert text to speech using the Google Text-to-Speech API and the gTTS library. It allows you to generate speech from text and save it as an audio file. You can also customize the output file name and language.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the TTS script on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
(For desktop operating systems only.)
For Android please use pydroid 3 from the Google Play Store.
### Installing

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-to-speech.git
cd text-to-speech
pip install gTTS
python tts.py
text = "Hello, this is a sample text-to-speech conversion."
output_file = text_to_speech(text)
